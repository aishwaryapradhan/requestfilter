# requestfilter
To filter request using a flask api on basis of alloted hits to a user identified by an authtoken.

This is basically more of a skeleton code based on flask and redis to filter out requests to a particular api based on the available number of hits alloted to it.

It basically helps for the businesses which are into paid api domain or simply want to restrict access to any resource.

I have used redis to store the number of counts we are getting from a particular auth code(An authentication code give by the provider itself to access the api.

Some code are are left as TODO's that can be filled with code to make it work, this for now is a dummy code.

I can add examples of customizing it and adding support to a particular system, just create an issue for the same.

For any other issues, create an issue here or mail me at aishwaryapradhan82@gmail.com

Have a Great Day.
